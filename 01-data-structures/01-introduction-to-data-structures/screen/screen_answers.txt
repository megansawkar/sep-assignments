1. To create a data structure that allows for access to pixels in a specific place on a screen, I recognized
    that there would be two aspects of data that would need to be stored and accessible; first, access to the
    point on the screen and second, access to the pixel colors on that screen. Because these two pieces of data
    are related to one another, and because access to one should mean that someone can have access to the other,
    I decided to use a hash for data storage. The hash requires no specific order and allows for one value to
    be the access point to the other value. In this case, the specific position on the screen (x and y) could
    be the key to finding the value of the pixel at that point.

    The hash in this instance allows a developer to use and store key value pairs for specific points in a
    2-dimensional rectangular shape. The nature of this is that there is no specific order. So, a developer
    would need to know what they are looking to find in order to access and/or manipulate data at a specific
    point or position.

2. The developer would search the hash for the correct key.

3. A hash can be used for real life data storage anytime a developer wants to be able to relate two pieces of data.
    For example, on something like a library website, a book might have an identification number (specific to the
    library and not just a number in a list of books) which can be related to the title of the book. These two
    pieces of data can be used to find one another using a hash.
