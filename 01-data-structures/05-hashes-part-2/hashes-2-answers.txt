Describe three resolution strategies:

1) Coalesced Chaining: This is a hybrid of separate chaining and open addressing. Using this resolution
strategy, one would create buckets for storage at given index locations. Inserting a new items would
involve: 1. assigning an index 2. checking to see if there is an item at that index 3. if not, adding
a bucket to store items to that index, followed by adding the item to the bucket... and if so, adding
the item to the bucket. In this scenario, if a collision occurs, the item would be placed anywhere in
that index bucket.

2) Two-Way Chaining: With this resolution strategy, keys are added by hashing with two hashes. In each
hash, there are buckets for storage at each index location. The key is then inserted in the array with
fewer colliding keys, or fewer items in the bucket at said index location. Using this method, the first
hash is always checked first and becomes the priority hash for inserting if both buckets have equal
items.
